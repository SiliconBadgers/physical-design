# Working in Synthesis and Physical Design

The immediate delivery is one reproducible Synopsys synthesis baseline for the chip and every unit, with explicit stubs where RTL is missing.

## Before editing or committing

- Read README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/START-HERE.md and the linked issue.
- Do not commit secrets, licensed collateral, model weights or generated
  build/simulation databases.
- Use a branch and PR for @abhinavnandwani's review. Keep the issue's technical
  scope intact; scaffolding and tone changes do not authorize a new design.

## AI assistance

If you use an AI agent, report the tool and exact model ID when available in
the PR description or change summary. State when the model is unavailable;
do not guess. No additional software, hooks or setup is required.

## Evidence and boundaries

- Link the central Architecture diagram instead of copying it. Distinguish
  accepted interfaces, proposals, assumptions, real RTL and stubs.
- Preserve dated experiment results and slide baselines. Put new work alongside
  them with revisions, commands, inputs, tool versions and limitations.
- Run checks appropriate to changed behavior. Never claim an unrun licensed-tool
  check passed or that a MAC/stub test validates the full accelerator.
- Software includes workload mapping and runtime/host integration. Do not invent
  a compiler team, custom CPU core or custom ISA.
- Keep the first delivery to chip plus every unit at one baseline configuration.
  Stubs do not establish full-chip PPA. Do not expand into floorplanning/signoff.
